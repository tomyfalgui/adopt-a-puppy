# Adopt a Puppy

This repository contains the `client` and `api` of the "Adopt A Puppy" system.

## Client

The client is a next-js typescript application using vitest as its runner.

### Scripts

`npm run dev`

## API

The api is a typescript express application


## Assumptions

1. Given the limited dataset and purpose of the application, filtering is done on the client-side.
2. For production-grade applications, it may be more performant to have the filtering on the backend.
